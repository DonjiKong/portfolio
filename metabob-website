I created the metabob website on webflow.

Problem:
I needed to build a 7 page website in 2 weeks that looked good enough to investors that we could raise a $1,000,000 seed round.


I chose to build the website in webflow because it gave me all the customization I needed without needing to rely on an engineer to execute my designs. 

In a startup speed is everything, so I opted for starting off with a template and editing from there so I could get everything done a couple days before the deadline.

I made the various graphics in figma.

My process starts off with meeting with the marketing team and discussing what needs to be built. 
I then tell them what is and isn't possible to create, and then they add the requirements to a google slide doc with a slide for each website section.
