I designed, animated, and built this animation for the metabob homepage.

Problem:
Users and investors needed to immediatley understand what our product does, but this wasn't happening.


Process:
I first met with the business team to go over what exactly needed to be communicated.
As we all discussed what should go in the animation, I quickly sketched out some storyboards on a piece of paper.
Then after I showed my team the drawing and verifed that is what they wanted, I then took the drawing into figma and vectorized it.
