I designed, animated, and built this animation for the metabob homepage.

Problem:
Users and investors needed to immediatley understand what our product does, but this wasn't happening.


Process:
I first met with the business team to go over what exactly needed to be communicated.

As we all discussed what should go in the animation, I quickly sketched out some storyboards on a piece of paper.

Then after I showed my team the drawing and verifed that is what they wanted, I then took the drawing into figma and vectorized it.

After vectorizing in figma, I exported the screens as SVGs and brought them into AfterEffects and animated it.

Next I used the AfterEffects lottie-files plugin, and exported it to the lottie web animation format and embedded it into the website using webflow.

For the last step I exported the website to css, html, and javascript, created a commit, then pushed to github.
